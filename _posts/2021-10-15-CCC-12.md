Finished the [Junior 2012 CCC](https://www.cemc.uwaterloo.ca/contests/computing/2012/stage1/juniorEn.pdf) in less than an hour. I spent 3-4 hours on the last 
question but couldn't solve it so I just left it unsolved.

# Speed Fines are Not Fine
{% highlight c++ %}

    int limit, current;
    cout << "Enter the speed limit: " << endl;
    cin >> limit;
    cout << "Enter the recorded speed of the car: " << endl;
    cin >> current;
    if(current <= limit){
        cout << "Congratulations, you are within the speed limit!" << endl;
        return;
    }else if(current < limit+20){
        cout << "You are speeding and your fine is $100." << endl;
        return;
    }else if(current <= limit+30){
        cout << "You are speeding and your fine is $270." << endl;
        return;
    }else{
        cout << "You are speeding and your fine is $500." << endl;
    }

{% endhighlight %}
This question was pretty easy, you get the speed limit and current speed, and calculate the difference between the two and print out the fine amount.

# Sounds Fishy
{% highlight c++ %}

    int a, b, c, d;
    cin >> a >> b >> c >> d;
    if(a < b && b < c && c < d){
        cout << "Fish Rising";
    }else if(d < c && c < b && b < a){
        cout << "Fish Diving";
    }else if(a == b && b == c && d == b){
        cout << "Constant Depth";
    }else{
        cout << "No Fish";
    }

{% endhighlight %}
This question was also pretty easy, you get the four depth distances, and check their relationships and print out the correct term for the relationship.

# Icon Scaling
{% highlight c++ %}

    int copy;
    cin >> copy;
    for(int x = 0; x < copy; x++){
        for(int y = 0; y < copy; y++)
            cout << "*";
        for(int y = 0; y < copy; y++)
            cout << "x";
        for(int y = 0; y < copy; y++)
            cout << "*";
        cout << endl;
    }
    for(int x = 0; x < copy; x++){
        for(int y = 0; y < copy; y++)
            cout << " ";
        for(int y = 0; y < copy*2; y++)
            cout << "x";
        cout << endl;
    }
    for(int x = 0; x < copy; x++){
        for(int y = 0; y < copy; y++)
            cout << "*";
        for(int y = 0; y < copy; y++)
            cout << " ";
        for(int y = 0; y < copy; y++)
            cout << "*";
        cout << endl;
    }

{% endhighlight %}
We first get the icon size, and then print out `copy` amounts of `*x*` in `copy` lines. We repeat this for the `  x` and `* *`.

# Big Bang Secrets
{% highlight c++ %}

    int k, value, temp;
    string word;
    cin >> k >> word;
    for(int x = 0; x < word.size(); x++){
        value = 3*(x+1) + k;
        temp = word[x]-value;
        if(temp < 65){
            temp+=26;
        }
        cout << (char)temp;
    }

{% endhighlight %}
We get the value of `k` and the word itself. we then get the number of letters (`value`) we go down in the alphabet to find the translated letter for that letter.
we then turn turn the letter into its ascii value by applying it to an int var and taking `values` values away from its ascii value. If `temp < 65`, meaning the 
translated letter is not in the alphabet, we add 26 to its ascii value to wrap it back into the alphabet. Then we print out the char version of that ascii value.
