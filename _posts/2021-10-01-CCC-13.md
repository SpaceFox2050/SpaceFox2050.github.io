Finished the [Junior 2013 CCC](https://www.cemc.uwaterloo.ca/contests/computing/2013/stage1/juniorEn.pdf) in around 1.75 hours. This CCC was harder compared to 
the last 2014 Junior CCC, especially the last question.

    int a, b;
    cin >> a >> b;
    cout << b+(b-a);

Don't think this question needs much explanation.

# Rotating Letters

{% highlight c++ %}

    string sign;
    string rotate = "IOSHZXN";
    cin >> sign;
    for(int x = 0; x < sign.size(); x++){
        for(int y = 0; y < rotate.size(); y++){
            if(sign[x] == rotate[y]){
                break;
            }else if(y == rotate.size()-1){
                cout << "NO";
                return;
            }
        }
    }
    cout << "YES";

{% endhighlight %}

We get the word and make a string with all the letters that can be rotated. We then loop through `sign` and see if any of the letters are not equal to any 
rotatable letter. If they are not equal to any, we print `NO` and return the func. If we get past all the checks we print `YES`


# From 1987 to 2013 (Distinct numbers)

{% highlight c++ %}

    int year;
    cin >> year;
    if(year <= 10){
        cout << year+1;
        return;
    }
    int consyr;
    while(true){
        year++;
        consyr = year;
        int digits = log10(year)+1;
        int nums [digits];
        bool found = true;
        for(int x = 0; x < digits; x++){
            nums[x] = consyr%10;
            consyr/=10;
        }
        for(int x = 0; x < digits; x++){
            for(int y = x+1; y < digits; y++){
                if(nums[x] == nums[y]){
                    found = false;
                    break;
                }
            }
            if(!found){
                break;
            }
        }
        if(found){
            cout << year;
            return;
        }

    }

{% endhighlight %}

We get the year. An extra `year <= 10` if statement is placed at the top because my code doesn't work for years <= 10. We then have an infinite loop to find the 
next distinct year. We first increment year by `1`, then store year in another temp var called `consyr`. We then get the number of digits in the year using log10.
Then we have a `for` loop getting every digit of `consyr` and store it in the `nums` array with the length `digits`. We then see if any of the digits in the array 
are equal to each other. If they are, we break and continue to iterate through `year`. If all digits are distinct, we print the year and return the func.

# Time on Task

{% highlight c++ %}

    int mins, tasks, complete = 0;
    cin >> mins >> tasks;
    int jobs[tasks];
    for(int& x:jobs)
        cin >> x;
    for(int x = 0; x < tasks; x++){
        for(int y = x; y < tasks; y++){
            if(jobs[x] > jobs[y]){
                jobs[x]+=jobs[y];
                jobs[y] = jobs[x] - jobs[y];
                jobs[x]-=jobs[y];
            }
        }
    }
    while(mins >= 0){
        mins-=jobs[complete];
       
        complete++;
    }
    if(tasks == 0){
        cout << complete;
    }else{
        cout << complete-1;
    }
    
{% endhighlight %}    
    
We get the `mins` and `tasks` we have, then we have a `int&` for loop to get all the task values. The array is then sorted in ascending order and we have a while loop that runs while `mins >= 0`. We take `jobs[complete]` values away from mins and increment `complete` by 1 every the the while loop runs. We first sorted the array in ascending order so that we complete the faster jobs first. At the end, if `tasks == 0`, meaning we used up all our time, we print `complete`, otherwise, we have gone over the time limit and done a job we didn't have time for, so we print `complete-1`.

We get the fav team number and numbersgames that have already been played. We then create 5 element containers listed below

1. vector<int> notfav: stores all the team numbers except for the fav team number
2. int points[4]: stores the points that each team has
3. int tplayed[2][played]: stores the teams that have already played each other
4. int tleft[2][6-played]: stores the teams that haven't played each other yet
5. int wleft[6-played]: stores the possibibilites for the teams left that haven't already played each other 
    
The next block of code is dedicated to initialize all 5 containers. We start by making every `points` element 0, and storing every team number that isn't the fav team in `notfav`. We then get the teams that have already played each other and store them in `tplayed`, we add team win values to the `points` array according to who won each game. We then add all teams that haven't played each other in `tleft`. Lastly we initialize `wleft` with all 0s.
    
We then have a while loop that runs while `wleft[0] != 3`. We have a temp array `tpoints` that temporarily stores the points for this iteration. We run a for loop that adds points to `tpoints` according to who has won. `wleft[x]%3 == 0` means the first team has won, `wleft[x]%3 == 1` means the second team has won, otherwise we assume it is a tie. We then check if `tpoints[fav-1]` is bigger than the points of other teams. If it is, we add one to `fwin`, which stores the times that the fav team has won. We then increase `wleft[5-played]` by one. If `wleft[x]%3 == 0 && wleft[x] != 0`, we increase `wleft[x-1]` by one. This is because we have gone through all the possibilites of `wleft[x]` for the current game state and we can increase the next gamestate by one. 
    
When the while loop ends we print out `fwin`.
