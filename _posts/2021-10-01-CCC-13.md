# UNFINISHED

Finished the [Junior 2013 CCC](https://www.cemc.uwaterloo.ca/contests/computing/2013/stage1/juniorEn.pdf) in around 1.75 hours. This CCC was harder compared to 
the last 2014 Junior CCC, especially the last question.

    int a, b;
    cin >> a >> b;
    cout << b+(b-a);

Don't think this question needs much explanation.

# Rotating Letters

{% highlight c++ %}

    string sign;
    string rotate = "IOSHZXN";
    cin >> sign;
    for(int x = 0; x < sign.size(); x++){
        for(int y = 0; y < rotate.size(); y++){
            if(sign[x] == rotate[y]){
                break;
            }else if(y == rotate.size()-1){
                cout << "NO";
                return;
            }
        }
    }
    cout << "YES";

{% endhighlight %}

We get the word and make a string with all the letters that can be rotated. We then loop through `sign` and see if any of the letters are not equal to any 
rotatable letter. If they are not equal to any, we print `NO` and return the func. If we get past all the checks we print `YES`
