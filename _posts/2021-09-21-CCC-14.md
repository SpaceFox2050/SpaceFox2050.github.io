Just finished the [CCC 2014 junior](https://www.cemc.uwaterloo.ca/contests/computing/2014/stage%201/juniorEn.pdf) questions in under half an hour. This CCC was 
easier compared to last year's [2015](https://www.cemc.uwaterloo.ca/contests/computing/2015/stage%201/juniorEn.pdf) one. Most of my CCC solutions are on my CCC 
GitHub repo.

# Triangle Times
{% highlight c++ %}

    int a, b, c;
    cin >> a >> b >> c;
    if(a == 60 && b == 60 && c  == 60){
        cout << "Equilateral";
        return;
    }else if(a + b + c == 180){
        if(a == b || a == c || b  == c){
            cout << "Isosceles";
            return;
        }else{
            cout << "Scalene";
            return;
        }
    }else{
        cout << "Error";
    }

{% endhighlight %}

Pretty easy question, dont think it needs any explanation.

# Vote Count
{% highlight c++ %}

    int votes, a = 0, b = 0;
    cin >> votes;
    for(int x = 0; x < votes; x++){
        char temp;
        cin >> temp;
        if(temp == 'A'){
            a++;
        }else{
            b++;
        }
    }
    if(a == b){
        cout << "Tie";
    }else if(a > b){
        cout << "A";
    }else{
        cout << "B";
    }
    
{% endhighlight %}

We count the votes as we input them to avoid storing the variables in a separate array. Then we print `A` or `B` depending on who wins, we also print `tie` if they have the same number of votes.

# Double Dice
{% highlight c++ %}

    int ant = 100, dav = 100, rolls, a, d;
    cin >> rolls;
    for(int x = 0; x < rolls; x++){
        cin >> a >> d;
        if(a > d){
            dav-=a;
        }else if(d > a){
            ant-=d;
        }
    }
    cout << ant << endl << dav;
    
{% endhighlight %}

Another pretty easy question, we just input the dice rolls for both the people and delete the higher roll value from the lower roll person's points. We then print out `ant` and `dav` at the end which are the two character's points.

# Party Invitation
{% highlight c++ %}

    //include vector library at top of code 
    //#include <vector>
    int friends, removals, temp;
    cin >> friends >> removals;
    vector<int> nums;
    for(int x = 1; x < friends+1; x++)
        nums.push_back(x);
    for(int x = 0; x < removals; x++){
        cin >> temp;
        for(int y = temp-1; y < nums.size(); y+=temp-1){
            nums.erase(nums.begin()+y);
        }
    }
    for(int num : nums)
        cout << num << endl;
        
{% endhighlight %}

We first get the number of friends and removals; then we make a vector that stores all the friend values. We then loop `removals` times to remove every `temp` friend, this is where the vector comes in use. We start at `temp-1` for every removal loop because that is the first friend removal, we then increment `y` everytime by `temp-1` because all indexs after the friend we moved will be lowered by one; we compensate for that by adding a `-1` to the end of every `temp` increment. Then at the end we loop through the `nums` vector and print out the friend numbers.

# Assigning Partners
{% highlight c++ %}

    int ppl;
    cin >> ppl;
    string part[2][ppl];
    for(int x = 0; x < ppl; x++){
        string one, two;
        cin >> one >> two;
        part[0][x] = one;
        part[1][x] = two;
    }
    for(int x = 0; x < ppl; x++){
        if(part[0][x] == part[1][x]){
            cout << "bad";
            return;
        }
        for(int y = 0; y < ppl; y++){
            if(x != y){
                if(part[0][x] == part[1][y] && part[1][x] != part[0][y]){
                    cout << "bad";
                    return;
                }
            }
        }
    }
    cout << "good";

{% endhighlight %}

We get the amount of people in the class and then we get the partners and store it in a `[2][ppl]` string array. We then loop through every pair. If the `[0][x]` is equal to `[1][x]`, that means someone is paired up with themselves, we print `bad` and return the function. We then loop through the `part` array again to check if two partners are not equal. I have `part[0][x] == part[1][y]` because every name can only appear once on top and bottom, if their partners: `part[1][x] != part[0][y]` are not equal, we print `bad` and return the function as well. If we get past every check we print `good`.
